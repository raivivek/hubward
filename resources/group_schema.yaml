            rsync, called as `rsync <locally-prepared track hub>
            <user>@<host>:<hub_remote>`. If deleted, empty, or set to empty
            strings, then you'll need to provide these details on the command
            line when calling `hubward upload`. Those command line arguments
            also override the corresponding option configured here.
